# INPUT DATA

<subreddit_reports>

{joined text__NODE_ID__:vTp3ULJ7vyhzG6zpQVnRgJ}

</subreddit_reports>

Each report contains comprehensive data from a subreddit, with items (quotes, needs, features, etc.) potentially flagged or attributed if they were `question_relevant="true"` by earlier stages.

# META-ANALYSIS OBJECTIVE

Your primary objective is to meticulously synthesize the provided <subreddit_reports> into a comprehensive "Insights & Evidence Report."

- Identify and extract **ALL significant cross-community patterns, themes, user needs, perspectives, language, and experiences.**

- Include a **high volume of direct, verifiable quotes with [Subreddit-PostID] attribution** for each finding.

- Where applicable and available from input, note if specific findings or quotes were flagged as `question_relevant="true"`. This highlighting is for informational purposes within this comprehensive report.

- Quantify findings where possible (e.g., frequency of themes/needs, number of posts mentioning X).

- Maintain rigorous context and attribution.

# META-ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES

1. **Comprehensiveness:** Prioritize extracting and structuring as much valuable information as possible from the input. Aim for depth and breadth.

2. **Quote Density:** Maximize the inclusion of unique, illustrative quotes. This report should be rich in verbatim user language.

3. **Evidence-Based Confidence:** Evaluate pattern strength based on frequency, consistency, clarity, sentiment, and diversity of evidence. Assign confidence levels.

4. **Context Preservation:** Ensure all insights and quotes are presented with sufficient context.

5. **Highlighting (Not Filtering) for User Question:** If data from input is marked `question_relevant="true"`, preserve this flag or note. This report includes *all* insights, with relevant ones to the question simply being noted as such.

# "INSIGHTS & EVIDENCE REPORT" STRUCTURE

- Assess the overall quality and richness of the combined <subreddit_reports> for understanding the general Problem Area and Target Audience.

- Note which subreddits were most insightful overall.

- Its typical usage, connotation, and context.

- Subreddits or segments it's most associated with.

- *If a term is frequently associated with discussions flagged `question_relevant="true"`, note this.*

## 9. Summary of Insights Specifically Relevant to User Question/Goal

In <question_specific_highlights_summary> tags:

- Based on the `question_relevant="true"` flags encountered throughout your synthesis:

- List the top 3-5 themes that had high relevance to the User Question/Goal.

- List the top 3-5 user needs most pertinent to the User Question/Goal.

- Provide 5-10 of the most powerful quotes that directly address the User Question/Goal, sourced from across the report.

- This section acts as a quick reference for data points specifically tied to the user's initial query, drawn from the comprehensive analysis above.

# OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

- Use ONLY plain text format with the XML tags specified.

- Ensure each quote includes full [Subreddit-PostID] attribution for traceability.

- Prioritize clarity, comprehensiveness, and data density.

- Where confidence levels are requested, provide them (High/Medium/Low) along with a brief justification.

- Structure content logically within each tag set.

- This output is intended to be a detailed, evidence-rich document.
