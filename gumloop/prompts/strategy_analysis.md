# OUTPUT OBJECTIVE

Create a focused report that directly answers the User's Primary Question/Goal. The report should:

1. Provide a clear, direct answer synthesized from the meta-analysis.

2. Support the answer with the most compelling cross-community evidence (key themes, direct quotes with attribution).

3. Offer actionable takeaways or strategic considerations *specifically related to the user's question*.

4. Be concise, well-structured, and easy to understand. Avoid overwhelming the user with excessive detail not pertinent to their question.

# REPORT STRUCTURE

## 1. Executive Summary & Direct Answer

In <executive_summary_and_answer> tags (Target 200-300 words):

- **IMPORTANT: Begin this section with the exact Markdown heading: `## Executive Summary & Direct Answer`**.

- Start with a direct, concise answer to the **User's Primary Question/Goal**.

- Briefly summarize the 2-3 most critical findings from the meta-analysis that support this answer.

- State the overall confidence in the answer based on the evidence (e.g., High/Medium/Low, with a brief rationale like "High, due to consistent themes and strong sentiment across multiple relevant subreddits").

## 2. Key Supporting Themes & Evidence

In <key_themes_and_evidence> tags:

- Detail 3-5 dominant themes or patterns from the <meta_analysis_summary> that directly support the answer provided in the executive summary.

- For each theme:

- Clearly state the theme.

- Provide 2-3 of the most impactful and diverse DIRECT QUOTES EXACTLY AS WRITTEN from the <meta_analysis_summary> that exemplify this theme. Copy quotes character-for-character. Ensure these quotes are highly relevant to the User's Primary Question/Goal.

- Briefly explain how this theme contributes to answering the User's Primary Question/Goal.

## 3. Deeper Dive: Audience Voice (Filtered by Relevance to the Question)

In <audience_voice_highlights> tags:

- **Relevant User Needs:** If applicable to the User's Question, list 1-3 top user needs identified in the meta-analysis that are critical to understanding the question's context. Include a powerful EXACT quote for each.

- **Key Language & Terminology:** Extract a list of 5-10 crucial terms, phrases, or emotional expressions users employ when discussing topics related to the User's Question. Provide brief context or meaning. Example: "'Life-saver' - used to describe solutions that automate X."

- **Perspectives on Alternatives/Solutions:** If relevant to the User's Question (e.g., if the question is about differentiation or existing solutions), summarize user sentiment towards 1-2 key alternatives/workarounds mentioned in the meta-analysis, focusing on aspects pertinent to the question. Include a representative EXACT quote.

## 4. Actionable Takeaways & Strategic Considerations (Tailored to the User's Question)

In <actionable_takeaways> tags:

- Based *only* on the findings related to the User's Primary Question/Goal, provide 3-5 specific, actionable recommendations.

- **Frame these takeaways according to the nature of the question.** Examples:

- If Question is about messaging: "Consider using [specific phrases] from user language." "Emphasize [value driver X] as it resonates strongly."

- If Question is about feature prioritization: "Feature [Y] appears to address a critical pain point related to your query." "Users expressed frustration with [aspect Z], suggesting an opportunity."

- If Question is about understanding a problem: "The core of this problem for users seems to be [synthesized insight]." "Focus on addressing [specific user need]."

- If Question is about audience segments: "Segment [A] shows the most acute need related to your question, prioritize their perspective."

- For each takeaway, briefly link it back to supporting evidence from the <key_themes_and_evidence> or <audience_voice_highlights>. Use EXACT quotes when referencing evidence.

## 5. Research Gaps & Potential Next Steps

In <research_gaps_next_steps> tags:

- Briefly note 1-2 unanswered questions or areas for further investigation that emerged *specifically from trying to answer the User's Primary Question/Goal*.

- Suggest 1-2 potential next research steps the user could take if they want to explore these gaps (e.g., "Conduct a targeted survey on [aspect]," "Run a V2 Subtext query focused on [sub-question]"). This should be very concise.

# FORMATTING GUIDELINES

- The report MUST begin with a section titled `## Executive Summary & Direct Answer`. This section should be enclosed in `<executive_summary_and_answer>` tags as specified in the Report Structure.

- Prioritize clarity and conciseness above all.

- Use clear headings and bullet points for readability.

- Ensure all quotes are copied EXACTLY as written - character-for-character.

- Avoid jargon. Write in plain, direct language.

- The entire report should be significantly shorter than the original "50 pages". Aim for a digestible length that delivers high value quickly.
