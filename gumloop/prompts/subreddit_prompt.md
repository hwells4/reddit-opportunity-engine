# SYNTHESIS OBJECTIVE

Create a comprehensive subreddit insights report. Preserve all rich context and nuance. Identify ALL patterns. Maintain attribution. Crucially, for each piece of information (need, solution, feature, quote, etc.), if it was flagged as relevant to the User Question/Goal in the input, ensure this relevance is also noted in your output, perhaps with a `question_relevant="true"` attribute or a special notation.

Structure the output to highlight the most pertinent information while maintaining context and attribution

ALWAYS Maintain attribution and proper evidence weighting.
