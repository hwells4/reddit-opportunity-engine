# Notion Quotes Table Integration - Project Plan

## Problem Statement

Need to expose all quotes captured for a specific run to users through Notion, displaying quote text, links, sentiment, theme, and other metadata in an organized table/database format.

## Architecture Decision

**Initial Approach**: Central quotes database with filtering (rejected due to API limitations)
**Final Approach**: Individual quotes database per run
- **Rationale**: Notion API cannot create filtered linked database views programmatically
- **Benefits**: Perfect client isolation, no filtering needed, cleaner UX, no API limitations
- **Performance**: Notion confirmed no limits on database creation, no pricing impact

## Solution Implementation

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Create notionQuotesHelpers.ts module
- **Status**: COMPLETED (Updated for individual databases)
- **Location**: `/app/api/add-to-notion/notionQuotesHelpers.ts`
- **Functions Created**:
  - `createQuotesDatabase()` - Creates dedicated database for each run
  - `formatQuoteForNotion()` - Simplified properties (no run/company fields needed)
  - `addQuotesToNotion()` - Batch inserts quotes with rate limiting
  - `fetchQuotesForRun()` - Gets quotes from Supabase for a specific run
  - `getQuoteStats()` - Calculates statistics by category/sentiment
  - `createQuotesLinkBlock()` - Simple link block (no filtering instructions needed)

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Create separate quotes API route
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Location**: `/app/api/add-to-notion/quotes/route.ts`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST` - Add quotes for a run to Notion
  - `GET` - Preview quotes for a run
- **Features**: Account lookup, batch processing, error handling

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Integrate quotes into main Notion flow
- **Status**: COMPLETED (Updated for individual databases)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Modified main route to create dedicated database per run
  - Database created as child of branded homepage
  - Simplified link block (no filtering instructions needed)
  - Non-breaking: quotes failure doesn't affect report creation

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Create test script
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Location**: `/test-notion-quotes.js`
- **Tests**: Quote fetching, stats calculation, integration flow

### ‚úÖ Task 5: Add post and quote counts to Notion reports
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Enhancement**: Display analysis statistics prominently in reports
- **Functions Added**:
  - `fetchRunStatistics()` - Gets posts and quotes count for a run
  - `fetchPostCountForRun()` - Gets just post count if needed
- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Analysis Summary callout box at top of homepage
  - Updated quotes link text to include post/quote counts
  - Clear metrics showing scope of analysis performed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Notion Database Schema (Simplified for Individual Databases)
```javascript
{
  "Quote": title,              // The quote text
  "Category": select,          // user_needs, user_language, etc.
  "Sentiment": select,         // positive, negative, neutral, etc.
  "Theme": select,            // general, user_feedback, etc.
  "Reddit Link": url,         // Link to source post
  "Relevance Score": number,  // 0.0 to 1.0
  "Date Added": date,         // When captured
  "Post ID": rich_text        // Reference to post
}
```
**Note**: No Run ID, Company, or Contact Email needed since each database is dedicated to one run/client.

### Integration Flow
1. Reports are created in Notion (existing functionality)
2. System fetches all quotes for the run from Supabase
3. Dedicated quotes database created as child of branded homepage
4. All quotes added to the dedicated database (no other quotes present)
5. Simple link block added to homepage directing to the quotes database

### Key Features
- **Dedicated Databases**: Each run gets its own quotes database
- **Perfect Isolation**: Clients only see their quotes (no filtering needed)
- **Analysis Statistics**: Prominently displays post and quote counts
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large quote volumes with rate limiting
- **Error Resilience**: Quote failures don't break report creation

# Webhook Resend & A/B Testing System - Implementation

## Problem Statement

Need ability to resend failed webhooks and A/B test different Gumloop workflows without re-running full discovery processes. Current system required starting from scratch for any webhook failures or testing new Gumloop configurations.

## Solution Architecture

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Add webhook payload storage to database
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Migration**: `002_add_webhook_payloads.sql`
- **Changes**: Added `webhook_payload`, `webhook_sent_at`, `webhook_response` to runs table
- **Timing**: Storage happens AFTER successful webhook send (not before)
- **Safety**: Only updates webhook fields, preserves all other run data

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Create Gumloop workflows management system
- **Status**: COMPLETED  
- **Migration**: `003_add_gumloop_workflows.sql`
- **Features**: Save workflow URLs with friendly names, auto-extract user_id/saved_item_id
- **API**: Full CRUD operations via `/api/workflows`

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Implement webhook resend API
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Location**: `/app/api/webhooks/resend/route.ts`

- **Location**: `/scripts/subtext-dev.ts`
- **Functions**:
  1. Create new Gumloop workflows (save URLs with names)
  2. Resend failed webhooks (with optional modifications)
  3. A/B test across multiple workflows
- **UX**: Clear menu system, continuous workflow, "exit" to quit

### ‚úÖ Task 6: Clean up redundant scripts
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Removed**: `webhook-manager.ts`, `resend-webhook.ts`, `test-webhook-resend.js`, `test-webhook-validation.js`
- **Remaining**: `subtext-v1.ts` (main), `subtext-dev.ts` (dev tools)
- **Package.json**: Updated to remove old script references

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints Created
```
POST /api/workflows - Save workflow URL with friendly name

- **Results**: Response time reduced from 120+ seconds (timeout) to ~13 seconds (success)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Quick Response Pattern
```typescript
// Phase 1: Essential Structure (< 10 seconds)
1. Fetch basic account data in parallel
2. Create parent page in database  
3. Create branded homepage with placeholders
4. Create report pages with truncated content
5. Add basic homepage blocks with loading indicators
6. Return success immediately

// Phase 2: Async Enhancement (background)
Promise.all([
  generateAITitleAsync(),     // Update page title
  generateHomepageIntroAsync(), // Add personalized intro
  processQuotesAsync()        // Create quotes database
]);
```

### Status Tracking API
```typescript
GET /api/add-to-notion/status?runId=xxx
{
  "status": "processing", // processing | completed | failed
  "progress": { "completed": 2, "total": 4, "percentage": 50 },
  "tasks": {
    "aiTitle": true,
    "homepageIntro": true, 
    "quotes": false,
    "reportFormatting": false
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

### Client Association Enhancement
- **Client ID**: Account UUID for precise tracking
- **Client Name**: Company name for easy identification  
- **Run ID**: Direct link to specific analysis run
- **Data Source Priority**: accountId ‚Üí runId ‚Üí email extraction

### Notion Conflict Resolution
