# Integration Strategy: Reddit Agent + SaaS Template

## Current Setup
- **Reddit Agent**: Python-based tool for discovering relevant subreddits
- **SaaS Template**: Existing template with Stripe, Drizzle ORM, Supabase, and Clerk for auth

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Move Reddit Agent into SaaS Template
- **Approach**: Copy the Reddit agent services into the existing SaaS template codebase
- **Benefits**:
  - Immediate access to production-ready auth, payments, and database infrastructure
  - Established user management flows
  - No need to rebuild Stripe integration for one-time payments
  - Drizzle ORM already configured for data management
- **Challenges**:
  - May require adapting Python services to work within the template's architecture
  - Potential environment configuration differences
  - Migration of existing code and dependencies

### Option 2: Import SaaS Components into Reddit Agent
- **Approach**: Selectively import needed components from SaaS template into the Reddit agent repo
- **Benefits**:
  - Maintains the current Reddit agent codebase structure
  - More granular control over which components to integrate
  - Potentially simpler if the Reddit agent has custom requirements
- **Challenges**:
  - More manual integration work required
  - Risk of missing dependencies or breaking interconnected components
  - Duplicating configuration already solved in the template

## Recommendation

**Option 1 (Move into SaaS Template) is recommended** for several reasons:
1. For a product with one-time payments, the payment infrastructure is critical and challenging to implement correctly
2. User authentication/management is already solved in the template
3. Database connections and ORM setup are significant work to recreate
4. The Reddit agent's core functionality is relatively self-contained and can be moved as a service

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Prepare SaaS Template
- Create a new repository from the SaaS template
- Update configuration for the Reddit product context
- Verify Stripe is configured for one-time payments rather than subscriptions

### 2. Integrate Reddit Agent
- Copy the `services/reddit_discovery_agent` directory into the template's appropriate services location
- Update imports and paths as needed
- Create Docker configuration matching the current setup

### 3. Create API Endpoints
- Develop REST API endpoints in the template that:
  - Accept the same inputs as the Reddit agent
  - Include authentication middleware
  - Apply payment requirements before processing
  - Return structured data to the frontend

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Create user interface components for:
  - Input collection (product type, problem area, target audience, context)
  - Displaying subreddit recommendations
  - Managing user account and payment history
  - Saving/organizing past searches

### 5. Database Structure
- Create tables for:
  - User searches
  - Saved subreddit collections
  - Usage metrics
  - Payment history

## Technology Stack Alignment

| Component | SaaS Template | Reddit Agent | Integration Notes |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Backend | Next.js API Routes | Python/FastAPI | Create Next.js API routes that call Reddit agent services |
| Database | Supabase/Drizzle | None currently | Use Supabase for storing search results and user data |
| Auth | Clerk | None currently | Use Clerk for user authentication |
| Payments | Stripe | None currently | Use Stripe for one-time payments |
| Deployment | Vercel (frontend) + Docker (services) | Docker | Maintain Docker for Reddit agent, deploy frontend on Vercel |

## Estimated Timeline
- Template preparation: 1 day
- Reddit agent integration: 2-3 days
- API endpoint creation: 1-2 days
- Frontend development: 3-5 days
- Testing and refinement: 2-3 days

## Next Steps
1. Audit SaaS template to ensure it supports one-time payments
2. Create inventory of specific components needed from the template
3. Develop integration tests to verify Reddit agent works within new structure
4. Design database schema for storing search results and user data
