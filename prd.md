# Reddit Discovery Slack Bot: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

A conversational Slack bot that replicates and enhances the existing CLI-based Reddit discovery workflow. Users can trigger discovery through natural conversation, iteratively refine parameters, select subreddits, configure campaigns, and launch automated outreach‚Äîall without leaving Slack.

## Product Vision

Transform the manual CLI process into a seamless conversational experience where users can:
- Paste customer conversations and get intelligent parameter extraction
- Iteratively refine discovery parameters through natural dialogue
- Review and select discovered subreddits with rich previews
- Configure and launch campaigns directly from Slack
- Track progress and receive notifications in real-time

## Current State vs. Target State

### Current CLI Workflow:
1. Run `python mvp_flow.py`
2. Answer prompts for product type, problem area, target audience, context
3. Wait for Reddit discovery to complete
4. Review discovered subreddits in terminal
5. Manually select relevant subreddits
6. Add additional subreddits if needed
7. Provide email and post limit
8. Trigger Gumloop webhook
9. Receive email notification when complete

### Target Slack Workflow:
1. **Trigger**: `@reddit-bot` or `/reddit-discover`
2. **Conversation**: Paste customer conversation or describe product
3. **Refinement**: Bot extracts parameters, user iterates until satisfied
4. **Discovery**: Bot triggers Reddit search, provides real-time updates
5. **Selection**: Interactive subreddit selection with previews and actions
6. **Enhancement**: Add custom subreddits with validation
7. **Configuration**: Set email and post limits through simple prompts
8. **Launch**: Confirm and trigger Gumloop pipeline
9. **Completion**: Receive success notification with tracking details

## Core Features

### 1. Conversational Parameter Extraction
**Purpose**: Intelligently extract and refine the four core parameters through natural dialogue

**Functionality**:
- Accept pasted customer conversations, product descriptions, or free-form text
- Use LLM to extract initial parameters (product type, problem area, target audience, additional context)
- Present extracted parameters for user review
- Allow iterative refinement through conversational feedback
- Maintain context across multiple refinement cycles

**User Experience**:
```
User: @reddit-bot analyze this conversation: [pastes customer chat]

Bot: üìã I've analyzed your conversation. Here's what I extracted:

**Product Type**: SaaS productivity tool
**Problem Area**: Remote team communication and project tracking
**Target Audience**: Small to medium tech startups (10-50 employees)
**Additional Context**: Looking for technical feedback on integration capabilities

Does this look accurate? You can ask me to adjust any of these.

User: The audience should focus more on engineering managers specifically

Bot: ‚úÖ Updated target audience to "Engineering managers at tech startups"

Here's the refined analysis:
**Product Type**: SaaS productivity tool  
**Problem Area**: Remote team communication and project tracking
**Target Audience**: Engineering managers at tech startups
**Additional Context**: Looking for technical feedback on integration capabilities

## Your Mission
Transform company information into actionable Reddit research by:
1. Extracting key research questions from company data
2. Defining clear audience, product, and problem statements
3. Identifying relevant subreddit communities using available research tools
4. Formatting everything for the Reddit Search MVP system

## Available Tools
- **FirecrawlMCP**: Use for scraping company websites, analyzing landing pages, and extracting structured information

**Audience**: A specific description of who the target customers are

### Step 4: Subreddit Research
Use your available tools to find relevant subreddits:

1. **Use FirecrawlMCP** to search for existing discussions:
   - Search for "[product category] recommendations site:reddit.com"
   - Search for "[target audience] communities site:reddit.com"
   - Search for "[problem area] discussions site:reddit.com"

2. **Use PerplexityMCP** for intelligent subreddit discovery:
   - Ask about best subreddits for specific audiences
   - Research communities where target problems are discussed
   - Find niche communities related to the product category

3. **Validate communities** by checking:
   - Active user bases (subscriber counts)
